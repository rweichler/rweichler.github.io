    <h1>Don't add this if you want Cylinder</h1>
    If you clicked on <a href="http://r333d.com/repo">r333d.com/repo</a> from some guy recommending Cylinder, don't add this! This repo was only necessary when Cylinder was in beta back in <u>2014</u>. It's been available by default in Cydia for over a year now.
    <h1>THIS IS A BETA REPO</h1>
    Huge ass disclaimer: this repo hosts UNSTABLE and BUGGY software. Only add this repo if you're okay with your phone possibly bricking. I hold no responsibility if you fuck your phone up.
    <h1>FOR PEOPLE WHO PIRATED EQUALIZEREVERYWHERE</h1>
    <p>
        You will either need to install CyDown or install the deb directly. Here is the link: <a href="debs/EQE.deb">EQE.deb</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Btw... Using CyDown or the direct .deb will get rid of the DRM popup that happens every couple of months.
        Don't use pirate repos. CyDown is the future.
